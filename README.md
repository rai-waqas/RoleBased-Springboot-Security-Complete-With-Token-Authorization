This project is entirely created by me by using Core Java Springboot to implement role-based user authentication and authorization using jwt tokens.
The project is completely working. The Databased used is MSSQL. Pom.xml file contains the MSSQL driver injection.
Project is well-structured into different directories for code readability and maintainability.
The "Authorization" directory contains the user jwt authentication and authorization classes.
The "Config" directory contains the project configuration with Springboot security implementation.
The "Controller" contains the controller classes that control the flow of commands and data.
In the same way, there are Exception Handler, Filters (for filtering the tokens), Helper methods, Models for Databases, Provider Classes for methods implementations, Repositories for schemas, and Service for handling user data.
